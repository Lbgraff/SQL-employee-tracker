My motivation was to gain a better understanding of SQL databases and how they can relate to each other.

I built this project in order to see how databases interact and get practice with this.

This application allows the user to enter and organize company data such as employees, departments, roles, and salaries.

I learned about SQL databases and got more practice with this subject. I gained a better understanding of primary and foreign keys and how to use them, as well as how to utilize PostgreSQL and Inquirer to interact with the application.

My application stands out because it is a simple and user-friendly way for company employees to interact with the database.

Screenshot titled image1 shows a user-friendly main menu that uses Inquirer to get input from user:
